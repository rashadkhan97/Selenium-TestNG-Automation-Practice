# 🚀 Selenium TestNG Automation Practice – DailyFinance (Gradle Project)

Welcome to my automation testing practice repository!  
This project documents my learning journey in **Selenium WebDriver automation** using the **TestNG framework**, managed with **Gradle**.  
The testing is done on the web application  
🔗 [https://dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net](https://dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net)

This repository is part of my training at **Road to SDET**. I regularly update it as I explore different website features like login, dashboard, and user management.
